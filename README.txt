Instructions:
All tasks are arranged into .py files of corresponding task numbers.

Extensions:
-> Evaluate more dimensions on task 3 - evaluated five different dimensions
    i.e. no. of convolutional filters, kernel size of convolution, no. of hidden nodes in dense layer, dropout rates and no. of epochs.
-> Explore a different computer vision task with available data - trained a CNN on CIFAR10 dataset and visualized the outputs of the trained network.
   Run 'extension_cifar10.py' for above extension.
